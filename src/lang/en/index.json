    "FAQ":{
        "FAQ": "Frequently Asked Questions",
        "q1": "1. Why is Seele Blockchain 4.0?",
        "a1": "1. We include several features of blockchain 3.0: faster consensus and transaction confirmation, high concurrency, cross-chain accessibility, better governance mechanisms, and more. <br><br>2. We add some improvements to existing algorithms and protocols. We propose fundamental protocol stacks for Value Internet and a heterogeneous forest network to connect and communicate with our own chains, Bitcoin, Ethereum and other blockchain systems. In addtion, we propose a Neural Consensus Algorithm whose performance scales linearly as network size increases. <br><br>3. Our governance mechanism is innovative. It takes into account efficiency and fairness, co-existence of various consensus algorithms, and various token systems and decentralized exchange rate mechanisms. <br><br>4. Seele provides a complete ecosystem of bottom-up technologies, architecture, and top-level applications, enabling all types of resources worldwide to trust each other for greater information exchange, business collaboration, and societal efficiency.",
        "q2": "2. What can Seele do？",
        "a2": "Whatever Bitcoin and Ethereum can do, we can do: transaction and smart contract operation. Our technologies are also agnostic to blockchain structures from single chain to directed acyclic graphs. We can easily support the deployment and consensus for nodes on the order of millions. Seele's technology can create and customize child chains as needed, incorporating consensus algorithms and governance structures to support and meet different types of business needs in different organizations.",
        "q3": "3. Is Seele open source?",
        "a3": "Yes! Seele adheres to the spirit of open-source development, supporting a cooperative and open ecosystem that welcomes new ideas and code contributions. Check out our Github at: https://github.com/seeleteam.",
        "q4": "4. What is the benefit of using your platform if the procedure for setting up child chains is much longer than setting gas prices like Ethereum?",
        "a4": "Child chains are used for resource isolation, faster transaction confirmation, lower fees, and meeting different business requirements.",
        "q5": "5. What are the advantages of Seele’s smart contracts compared to what other competitors offer?",
        "a5": "Advantages include JVM, layered protocols, pluggable support for EVM, Web Assembly, and more.",
        "q6": "6. Are all of Seele's concepts proven?",
        "a6": "Our network and consensus are not only proven concepts but are also verified through prototypes in our test network. We're trying to test these in a larger scale network.",
        "q7": "7. Do we know if Seele's concepts are viewed positively by the blockchain community?",
        "a7": "Yes, we've had positive reviews about our whitepaper. Suggestions to improve our product are welcome!",
        "q8": "8. Is the team really that strong? It looks good on a website, but when you dig deeper it's primarily academics.",
        "a8": "A lot of our team members are experienced engineers and from Microsoft, Tencent, Baidu, and more.",
        "q9": "9. How does the Neural Consensus Algorithm prevent double spending？",
        "a9": "The Neural Consensus Algorithm converges to a few block producers after the first round of fast whole-network consensus. These block producers use the pBFT consensus algorithm to select the final block producer to validate the double spending and confirm transactions.",
        "q10": "10. How does the Neural Consensus Algorithm avoid some typical attacks, such as DoS and Sybil attacks？",
        "a10": "Unlike the DPoS, all nodes participate in consensus in our algorithm, which means that an attacker cannot succeed unless it can handle more than 1/3 or 1/2 of the nodes. Our algorithm weighs nodes based on the balance in their account. So, as long as a weighted fraction (over 1/2) of the nodes are honest, a Sybil attack can be avoided. If successful, the attacker must possess more than half the amount of tokens in the entire network. The cost of such an attack will be very huge and outweighs the gains, making it meaningless.",
        "q11": "11. The more nodes, the faster the consensus process. How does the Neural Consensus Algorithm work?",
        "a11": "The algorithm is inspired by the ideas of biological neural networks. For example, let's use visual recognition within the brain: when the eye receives external light signals, billions of neurons in the brain are linked to identify the signal and determine what the signal represents. This procedure is the consensus of billions of neurons. We propose a Neural Consensus Algorithm that transforms the consensus problem into the processing of large-scale concurrent requests in asynchronous systems to sort the data. In brief, multiple nodes participate collaboratively and concurrently, cooperating in the shared partitioning. The higher the degree of participation, the faster the consensus convergence is reached.",
        "q12": "12. How does the Neural Consensus Algorithm determine the block producer?",
        "a12": "During the first round of the block consensus process, a group of nodes is randomly selected as block producer candidates, according to the contribution of each node (received and processed consensus requests). Then the pBFT algorithm is used to choose the final node producer.",
        "q13": "13. Can the Neural Consensus Algorithm avoid forks, and if so, how?",
        "a13": "Forks can be avoided. The algorithm ensures that the final selected node producer is honest and that there is only one.",
        "q14": "14. How is the genesis block produced?",
        "a14": "When a new chain is created, the system account initializes a transaction to generate the genesis block.",
        "q15": "15. How is a child chain created in a heterogeneous forest network？",
        "a15": "There are three steps in this process. Firstly, the upper level chain registers information about the chain account and its transaction namespace. Secondly, a consensus mechanism is negotiated with the upper level chain. Finally, the genesis block of the child chain is generated.",
        "q16": "16. Do transactions within the child chain need to ask the upper level chain for consensus?",
        "a16": "No, this is not required. Only cross-chain transactions need to ask the upper level chain for consensus.",
        "q17": "17. What is the relationship between the Value Transfer Protocol (VTP) and TCP/UDP?",
        "a17": "The Value Transfer Protocol (VTP) is based on the TCP / UDP protocol. It is specifically optimized for value transport in a blockchain network, adding richer protocol control and semantic fields.",
        "q18": "18. What is the relationship between Value HTTP (VHTTP) and HTTP？",
        "a18": "VHTTP is an application layer protocol, designed to leverage the Internet Protocol (HTTP) for the Value Internet, and facilitates asset registration, discovery and other services.",
        "q19": "19. How does cross-chain communication work？",
        "a19": "Cross-chain communication uses our cross-chain protocol stack, including Value Transport Protocol (VTP), Value HTTP (VHTTP) protocol and Unified Asset Identifier (UAI).",
        "q20": "20. How is safety of computing and data exchange for inter-chain and cross-chain ensured?",
        "a20": "A security sandbox is used that is based on trusted and verifiable computing to ensure the security of results and data exchange.",
        "q21": "21. What is the max transactions per second (TPS) for Seele?",
        "a21": "On the order of millions of TPS, but this may depend on different factors.",
        "q22": "22. Can all the child chains be mutually connected to each other directly? Or do all the connections need to go back to the main final top parent meta chain for communication?",
        "a22": "Yes. Two child chains can connect directly if no consensus is needed for upper level chain.",
        "q23": "23. How is the meta blockchain idea advantageous compared to Icon? Icon is an ecosystem to create and connect lots of blockchains. Connecting to the existing blockchain is a huge advantage. How does the heterogeneous forest network, which builds a hierarchical blockchain, advantageous compared to Icon?",
        "a23": "You can just consider our meta blockchain as the genesis blockchain to handle global consensus and global asset registration and as the parent chain for all child chains in one forest ecosystem. Based on the meta blockchain, users can create different child chains to meet different requirements for business models, resource isolation, lower transaction fees, and more.",
        "q24": "24. How will Seele solve the storage problem?",
        "a24": "Seele can leverage on-chain and off-chain storage systems, such as traditional databases and distributed file systems.",
        "q25": "25. How does Seele prevent the nodes from colluding?",
        "a25": "Colluding is a type of attack, such as a Sybil attack. Our consensus algorithm weighs nodes based on the balance in their account. So, as long as a weighted fraction (over 1/2) of the nodes are honest, the Sybil attack can be avoided. If successful, the attacker must spend more than half the amount of money on the entire network node. The cost of such an attack will be very huge and outweighs the gains, making it meaningless.",
        "q26": "26. Does the heterogeneous forest network incorporate machine learning/deep learning? Will increased use of this feature allow for faster connection and communication as it is trained on more data?",
        "a26": "Currently we don't have direct reference to machine learning and deep learning. We will try to introduce them into our heterogeneous forest network to improve its scalability and performance in the future.",
        "q27": "27. What are the programming languages supported by Seele's smart contracts?",
        "a27": "Our smart contracts are web-assembly like and also compatible with EVM. They provide a plug-in programming interface that integrates external libraries and resources to meet the diverse needs of different business models.",
        "q28": "28. We are trying to build a cross-chain protocol to communicate with other blockchains such as Ethereum. Is it technologically possible to switch some existing projects that are already built on the smart contracts of Ethereum to the Seele blockchain?",
        "a28": "Yes, you can. We have plans to leverage some existing projects (such as Cosmos) and technical ideas into our cross-chain protocol and Value Internet protocol stack to improve the blockchain ecosystem. Currently, we're focusing on the fundamental level protocol instead of application level for cross-chain communication.",
        "q29": "29. If Seele integrates with an existing project in Ethereum, will the existing project have the same transaction speed and functionality as a new project launch on Seele, or is the existing project still limited in terms of the speed and functionality because it is within Ethereum network?",
        "a29": "Cross-chain protocol just builds a bridge to communicate with each other for transferring value and exchanging information, instead of changing the architecture of existing blockchains. Therefore, the transaction confirmation speed and functionality will remain unchanged.",
        "q30": "30. Are the transaction speeds of different sub-blockchains mutually effective? Will the transaction speed of the chain affect the parent or child chain?",
        "a30": "Different sub-blockchains are separated, which means resource isolation. Speed of the chain isn't affected by their parent or child chain, unless the child chain asks the parent chain for consensus.",
        "q31": "31. What is the max number of blockchains that can be created within Seele in theory? If it is unlimited in theory, what restricts the growth in the chain in real life practice?",
        "a31": "It is unlimited in theory. In practice the number of chains depends on business requirements and our implemented data structure.",
        "q32": "32. How do user nodes deploy QVIC protocol?",
        "a32": "Users download our wallet or blockchain browser. There is no additional manual involvement for the user.",
        "q33": "33. Does Seele have miners？",
        "a33": "No. We reward users based on their contribution, including the number of times consensus has been reached and the number of producing blocks.",
        "q34": "34. How do I join?",
        "a34": "Just download the client (wallet or browser) and register an account.",
        "q35": "35. How do I get token rewards?",
        "a35": "You can get more tokens by staying online and improving network speed and connectivity.",
        "q36": "36. Do users need to download all blockchain data for consensus？",
        "a36": "No. Only a light-weight dataset is necessary for consensus.",
        "q37": "37. How do I become a block producer?",
        "a37": "There is no way to know who will be a block producer. The algorithm randomly selects based on nodes' contribution to the consensus.",
        "q38": "38. Does Seele charge a transaction fee? If so, how is this charged?",
        "a38": "Yes. Costs are calculated according to the transaction value and the current state of the network in order to maintain the trading efficiency and fairness for all users.",
        "q39": "39. What are the components of the transaction cost?",
        "a39": "The computing, storage and network bandwidth resources, the weighted costs involved in the transaction, and the current network status. Users launch a transaction or run a smart contract. We evaluate the input/output size of data, CPU time, and memory occupation for it to calculate the cost. If the current network is busy, which means there are too many transactions pending for processing, the cumulative weight will also be added into the cost.",
        "q40": "40. How can a transaction be confirmed faster?",
        "a40": "This is determined by our consensus algorithm. We do not provide the external interface and mechanism to encourage users to interfere with the speed of transaction confirmation in order to maintain the fairness of the whole network. For transactions that require faster confirmation, you can create a separate child chain for faster transaction confirmation, greater transaction concurrency, and lower transaction costs.",
        "q41": "41. Is there a test network for development and testing?",
        "a41": " Yes, and it is free to use. You can join in our testnet at: https://github.com/seeleteam/go-seele/wiki/Getting-Started-With-Seele",
        "q42": "42. What IDE/tools are used for development?",
        "a42": "SeeleIDE is a powerful IDE for visualization, templating, smart contract development, testing, and deployment.",
        "q43": "43. Is Seele's VM compatible with Ethereum and EOS?",
        "a43": "Yes, and it is more powerful and more customizable. Developers can customize contract virtual machines to meet the specific needs of different businesses.",
        "q44": "44. Is the token supply unlimited?",
        "a44": "No. We only issue 1 billion Seele tokens.",
        "q45": "45. Where can I exchange Seele tokens?",
        "a45": "Currently, Seele is listed on HADAX, a brand of Huobi, China’s biggest exchange. Seele/BTC, Seele/ETH pair trading has been available on HADAX since May 2018. For more information about trading Seele tokens on HADAX, please refer to https://www.hadax.com/notice_detail/?id=1665",
        "q46": "46. To become a node in the Seele Blockchain, what computer do I need? Do I need a strong CPU, strong GPU, or both? Or will anything decent with good internet do?",
        "a46": "A commodity computer will be enough to join us. The computation cost is lightweight.",
        "q47": "47. Can I run a master node with Seele?",
        "a47": "There are no master nodes in Seele.",
        "q48": "48. Block builders are able to change the blockchain. Can you clarify the meaning of this? Does this mean upgrades and introduction of new features, or does it include modifying blocks?",
        "a48": "No, block builders, or block producers, are elected by consensus procedures to pack transactions and add them to the blockchain. Block producers are not fixed and are randomly selected each round. Block producers just pack transactions and have no other function.",
        "q49": "49. Is Seele's ERC20 token an IOU for future replacement?",
        "a49": "Yes. When the main network is online, the current tokens will be mapped. We will release more details later.",
        "q50": "50. When will the tokens from the bounty program be released?",
        "a50": "It will be released within 4 weeks of the end of the bounty program.",
        "q51": "51. In theory if Seele achieves 1 million TPS, will the team consider going past 1 million TPS in the future?",
        "a51": "Yes, we will keep improving and upgrading our consensus algorithm and architecture to be more scalable and achieve higher TPS.",
        "q52": "52. Are there plans to join with other cross chain projects?",
        "a52": "Yes. But currently we're focusing on the fundamental level protocol instead of application level for cross-chain communication.",
        "q53": "53. When will the mainnet be available?",
        "a53": "The mainnet will be available by the end of Q4 of 2018."
